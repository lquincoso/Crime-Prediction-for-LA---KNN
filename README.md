# Crime-Prediction-for-LA---KNN
This Repository contains comprehensive code for predicting crime based on the dataset published by: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present. For visual display purposes, the predictions would be done through a StreamLit dashboard API.


#### =====================================================================================

## This Repostory meets the project requirements of CAP4612 and CIS3950, and serves as a Final Project


Instructions for using the model:
- <b>Part 1</b>: Download the folder.
- <b>Part 2</b>: Run the Jupyter Notebook under 'jupyter notebook - ML training and testing' folder in order to see the training/testing model on the dataset. Run the notebook in order to save the model. Save it under the folder 'models' (the streamlit app will crash otherwise).
- <b>Part 3</b>: Access if possible to the Command Prompt (Commander from Anaconda Navigator is recommended), and type: 'pip install streamlit-folium' if you don't have the package installed already on your system.
- <b>Part 4</b>: Through the same Prompt, 'cd' to the downloaded folder.
- <b>Part 5</b>: Ensure the dependencies are installed by typing on the Prompt: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.  
- <b>Part 5</b>: Run the streamlit app by typing the following Prompt: 'streamlit run streamlit_app.py' for a visual display of the data.
